# Run PRIMO with Binder

You can run PRIMO with [Binder](https://mybinder.org): a public cloud service that provides a temporary and shot-lived sandbox environment to run PRIMO without installing any software locally. 

## Quickstart

You can launch the Binder environment by clicking on the following badge: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/apd-ypuranik/primo-optimizer/binder)

## Key Notes

* Binder environments are automatically destroyed after a [few minutes of inactivity](https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/user-guidelines.html#how-long-will-my-binder-session-last). To avoid lost work, please download the notebook file on your local machine periodically.
* The Binder provided environment is **public and insecure**. Please do not use this environment to work with sensitive data.
