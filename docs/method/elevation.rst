Elevation Data
==============

PRIMO proposes the use of elevation as one of the factors that indicate the ease of plugging a well. A large elevation difference between
the well head and the nearest road point might indicate difficulties in accessing the well.

PRIMO makes available several `elevation-based utilities <https://primo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Utilities/elevation_utils.html>`_ to aid the 
calculation of elevation difference as a factor in the `project efficiency score calculation <https://primo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/method/efficiency_score_calculation.html>`_.
The utilities require the user to provide elevation data in the form of a GeoTIFF file for the area of interest. Users can download this data from
`USGS Science Data Catalog <https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/data/USGS:35f9c4d4-b113-4c8d-8691-47c428c29a5b>`_ which makes available several elevation
datasets publicly available. Users are also welcome to use proprietary datasets if any are available to them.
